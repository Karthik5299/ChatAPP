# Building a Real-Time Chat Application

## Overview
I developed a full-stack real-time chat application with features such as user authentication, real-time messaging, and a dynamic UI that responds to user interactions. My goal was to create a seamless communication platform while gaining hands-on experience with both frontend and backend technologies.

## Technical Stack
### Frontend:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling components quickly.
- **Daisy UI**: A component library built on Tailwind CSS for pre-designed UI elements.

### Backend:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side programming.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for handling HTTP requests and managing routing.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store user profiles and messages.
- **Socket.IO**: A JavaScript library enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.

## Development Process
### Backend Setup:

- Structured the server using Express.
- Implemented user authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Created RESTful API endpoints for user signup, login, fetching messages, and sending messages.
- Integrated real-time messaging using Socket.IO for instant message delivery.

### Frontend Development:

- Built UI components: login/signup forms, chat windows, and user profiles.
- Used React state management for handling authentication and user interactions.
- Styled the application with Tailwind CSS for a responsive design.
- Integrated user authentication flow to allow access to chat functionality.

### Real-time Features:

- Established bidirectional communication using Socket.IO.
- Implemented event listeners to trigger UI updates when messages are sent or received.
- Handled user status updates (online/offline) in real-time.


## Functionality

- **User Authentication:** Secure signup, login, and logout functionalities.
- **Real-time Messaging:** Instant messaging without requiring a page refresh.
- **Dynamic UI:** Interface updates dynamically to reflect online users and message exchanges.
- **Theme Switching:** Users can personalize their experience by switching between different UI themes.

## Conclusion
Developing this real-time chat application allowed me to reinforce key web technologies and concepts while gaining practical coding experience. From backend authentication to real-time messaging and UI responsiveness, this project was a valuable learning experience in full-stack development.
